The Sign pattern using HCI system on deep ensemble learning is a sophisticated HCI approach that allows computer control via hand gestures, eliminating the need for physical touch. By leveraging OpenCV and Media Pipe, it delivers accurate, real-time gesture recognition without using CNNs. OpenCV manages image processing tasks, such as identifying hand contours and features, while Media Pipe tracks 21 hand landmarks, providing precise hand position and movement data. This system uses a webcam to capture video frames, with Media Pipe identifying hand landmarks in each frame. It recognizes static gestures by examining the positions of landmarks and dynamic gestures by following their movement over time. These gestures are then converted into mouse functions, such as using a pinch gesture for a left-click or a swipe gesture for scrolling. This contactless interface enhances hygiene and reduces contamination risks, increases accessibility for individuals with physical impairments, and boosts user satisfaction through intuitive interaction. Although there are challenges, like varying lighting conditions, recognizing complex gestures, and optimizing performance for real-time use, this system marks a major advancement in HCI. It offers a practical alternative to traditional input devices without the complexity of CNNs, paving the way for more accessible and hygienic interaction methods in diverse applications.
